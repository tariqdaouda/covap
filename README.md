# Epitopes.world front-end (AI for COVID-19 Vaccine)

This is the front-end of https://epitopes.world. It everything you see on the website.

The COVID-19 is a pandemic of humongous human and economic consequences. We have developed an AI algorithm that can help identify useful targets for a vaccine against COVID-19.

Testing vaccines is a very lengthy process and patient samples are rare, fragile and precious. By making our results public, our goal is to significantly reduce the pool of targets to be tested, thus accelerating the development of a vaccine.
