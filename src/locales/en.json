      "intro": "The AI algorithm we use is called CAMAP and was developed at the {IRIC} during Tariq Daouda's PhD. The original application for CAMAP was cancer immunotherapy. However, because it has learned general patterns about the immune system, CAMAP can also unveil virus weaknesses. And could speed up the discovery of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.",
      "panel1":"1- Cells present at their surface tiny fragments of the proteins that they contain. These bits are called epitopes and serve to indicate to the immune system whatâ€™s happening inside the cells. When a cell gets infected by a virus, the genetic material from the virus is injected into the cell.",
      "panel2":"2- Then, the production of new viruses from this genetic material begins. However, some (but not all) fragments from the viral proteins produced also get presented at the cell surface.",
      "panel3":"3- By analysing the genetic sequence of the virus, our artificial intelligence algorithm (CAMAP) can predict which fragments of this virus are more likely to be presented at the cell surface.",
      "panel4":"4- We can then select a combination of fragments that have a high chance of being presented at the surface, we can design a vaccine that will efficiently train our immune system.",
      "panel5":"5- If immune cells then encounter infected cells, they can rapidly recognize them and kill the virus.",
